# Welcome

You have made it to the Front-end Repository for the TrueKonnect Web App. We have a couple notes that will help you understand what is going on in the code.

We have built the Client side application using popular tools such as React, Redux, Firebase, and Storybook.

The Web app is being built with a future React-Native app in mind. We are developing Components in the Storybook to ensure true reusability.


# Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
2. Run `yarn`
3. Use `yarn start` to run the React Server
4. Use `yarn run storybook` to run the Storybook Server
